# voidproof
VoidProof is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that protects users from getting killed in the void (below the y coordinate of 0). If you have a world that floats in the air and players have the ability to accidentally fall off and die, this plugin might be for you. Simple add the world's name into the config.yml file, and define a proper location to teleport them to. 

Things to do:
  1. Add permissions
  2. Create commands to add/remove worlds to the configuration.
  3. Create command to define the transport location.
